I was lucky to have had the opportunity to learn about the global snakebite crisis through this project and to get to put my design skills to use to bring about more awareness for both those affected and not. While this poster only covers climate conditions, I can see it becoming a much fuller and more compelling story with the incorporation of data on patterns in wealth, hospital accessibility and funding, and much more."

While we share a love for music, the rock music that he loves is nothing like the mellow tunes of the music I listen to and embody. Nonetheless, I took this on as a way to challenge myself to do something of a different feel. After many FaceTime consultations from coast to coast of the US and getting the drawing of my friend’s iconic bowl-cut and glasses just right, I ended up with this poster that captures the boldness of rock, nostalgia of a documentary, and my friend's personal brand. “Rockumentary” is the musical documentary of the rock music that shaped his life."

This project, focusing on information design, was done in the studio section for Design Process and Practices. It is one of my favorites from pieces I’ve done at school as it was when I discovered my attachment to information design. Unlike most designs that take lots of drafting and sketching, this one came together rather naturally.  I loved figuring out how to fit together all the information, establishing the typographic hierarchy, and coming up with the simple  lines and circle “arrows” that guide the viewer from one point to the next."
